Guide for preparing Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
for use in a BOINC infrastructure on Linux clients.
---------------------------------------------------

1. Requirements
---------------

   i. JRE available at http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

   ii. DC-API for java (libdcapi-java-client-0.9.so, libdcapi-boinc-client.so)

2. Preparing 
------------

   i. Extract the 'bin' and 'lib' directories from the JRE distribution.
      This can be done, by installing JRE on a machine and locating the
      necessary directories in the installation directory.
      Copy these two directories with all of their content to a directory
      called jre.

   ii. Put the files of DC-API in a directory called lib
   
   iii. Tar the contents of the above directories (jre, lib) in an archive
	called lidc-jre.tar
	eg.: tar czvf lidc-jre.tar jre lib


3. Deploying a java application on a BOINC server
-------------------------------------------------

   i. The java application on BOINC consists of the following 
      a. libdcapi-jre.tar - the jre prepared in part 2.
      b. application.jar - the java application to be run in BOINC
      c. launcher - script that untars jre and calls java with the
	 jar of the application on the client computer
   
   ii. Give execution rights to the launcher script only.

   iii. Proceed with signing the files and installing them to the boinc server as usual...
