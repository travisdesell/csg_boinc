This package provides access to the Distributed Computing Platform from the Java
language.

<p>
The underlying JNI library understands the following system properties:
<ul>
<li><tt>dc.jni.debug</tt>: If set, additional debugging messages are
	logged for every command and every metric value received. The value of
	this property consists of a series of tokens separated by commas. The
	possible tokens are understood:
	<ul>
	<li><tt>all</tt>: turn on all debugging options.
	<li><tt>event</tt>: log the reception of events.
	<li><tt>exception<tt>: log the generation of exceptions.
	</ul>
	Every token except <tt>all</tt> can be prefixed with "<tt>no</tt>" to
	prohibit the corresponding messages.
</ul>
