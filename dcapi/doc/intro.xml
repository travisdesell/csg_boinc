  <para>
    The DC-API was created by MTA SZTAKI to allow easy implementation and
    deployment of distributed applications on multiple grid environments.
  </para>
  <para>
    In order to accomodate the needs of very different grid environments, the
    DC-API supports only a restricted master-worker programming model. The
    restrictions include:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Master-worker concept: there is a designated
	  <emphasis>master</emphasis> process running somewhere on the grid
	  infrastructure. The master process can submit worker processes called
	  <emphasis>work units</emphasis>.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Every work unit is a sequential application.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  There is support for limited messaging between the master and the
	  running work units. It can be used to send status and control
	  messages, but it is not suitable for parallel programming.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  There can not be any direct communication between work units.
	</para>
