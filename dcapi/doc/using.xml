    <para>
      The DC-API library uses the <command>pkg-config</command> system to help
      the building of applications. For every backend, two
      <command>pkg-config</command> modules are available:
      <literal>dcapi-<replaceable>&lt;backend&gt;</replaceable>-client</literal>
      for building client applications and
      <literal>dcapi-<replaceable>&lt;backend&gt;</replaceable>-master</literal>
      for building master applications.
    </para>

    <para>
      During compilation, the <command>pkg-config --cflags
	<replaceable>&lt;module&gt;</replaceable></command> command gives the
      list of compiler directives (like include file locations) that have to be
      passed to the compiler whenever one of the DC-API headers is referenced in
      a source file.
    </para>

    <para>
      During linking, the <command>pkg-config --libs
	<replaceable>&lt;module&gt;</replaceable></command> command will return
      the list of libraries and linker options required to link the application
      with DC-API.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you have built DC-API from source and have installed it at a
      non-standard location (i.e. not under <filename>/usr</filename> or
      <filename>/usr/local</filename>), you may have to set the
      <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> environment variable to point to the
      directory where the <filename>.pc</filename> files are located in order
      to <command>pkg-config</command> to find them.
